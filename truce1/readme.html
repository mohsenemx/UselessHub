        1. TRUCE-1 is NOT certified for security. I only made it as a hobby.
        Please use at your own caution.

        2. The unencrypted key is printed to console, although this is not really a security flaw/issue, it's something you have to keep an eye for.

        3. The encrypted output can include spaces. they are part of encryption and removing them might cause data loss.

        4. Any changes to key, including adding spaces to it, can break the decryption.

        5. As of now, TRUCE-1 only supports ASCII characters, I plan on adding support for UNICODE characters to TRUCE-2.
